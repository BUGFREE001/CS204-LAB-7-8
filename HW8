Initially we have defined a variable r as 20, 
Then we have defined pinter p which contains address of r then p is passed by pointer in function fun where its value is changed to 10. 
Since it is passed by pointer. So, changes would also reflect in main.
Hence. the output is 10

#2

In 2nd question it using function pointer.
Which means it is storing the address of function and then calling it with the value 10. 
So, it will print Value of a is 10
